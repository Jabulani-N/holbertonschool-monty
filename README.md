# Task 0 - Push, Pall

we want an "opcode" called "push" that pushes an element to the stack

- **reminder: "stack" is a linked list structure that we defined in header monty.h** 

we want another "opcode" called "pall" that Prints All values in the stack, from top (last?) to bottom

## To-do

we need to learn what an opcode is, or maybe just look how to make an opcode that does the first task.

from that we'll learn how to make an opcode in general.

- biggest deal is we msut learn how this "opcode" works. besides that, we're just playing with a linked list.
