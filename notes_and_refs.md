[Stack Operations Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfBnp5ll2so&list=PLWPirh4EWFpG49yASGCmvOwXwVvgnm6Jt&index=70) (part of playlist)

the stack is a preallocated quantity of space ready to be filled with Pringles

- when empty, the top of the stack is -1.

- when there is one element in the stack, the top is 0

- - after all, the first element of anything is in position 0

- when there are two elements, the top is 1

pop deletes the current top element.

- no operation can dig through a stack.

- - you must take the top Pringle to mess with the chip below
